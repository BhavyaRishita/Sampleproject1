                Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us
                would
                reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a
                website attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of
                front-end development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
            </p>

                front-end design

                    <h4> Commenting </h4>
                    <p>
                        Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that
                        are
                        written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you
                        create. With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in
                        and
                        understand where things are at and how they work.

                    <h4> Invest In Productive Tools. </h4>
                    <p>
                        The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart
                        plugins,
                        the amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web
                        tools that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery,
                        Emmet, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.

                    <h4>Always Be Curious. </h4>
                    <p>
                        A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and
                        innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about
                        front-end
                        development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and
                        useful
                        learning sources for front-end developers -

                    <h4> Refactor Your Code From Time To Time. </h4>
                    <p>
                        By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its
                        functionality.
                        This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do
                        it,
                        your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before.
                        Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it
                        ensures
                        your code remains free from plagiarism.

                    <h4> Version Control </h4>
                    <p>
                        As a developer, version control is something that you must know about. Version control systems
                        let
                        you keep track of changes made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it easy
                        to
                        revert back to an earlier version if you screw something up. Thus using verion control will save
                        you
                        some sleepless nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control systems is Git. Thus
                        knowing git has been a requirement for almost every development job these days.

                While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must
                always
                remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create
                your
                signature style.
